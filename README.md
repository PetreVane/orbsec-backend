## Orbsec-backend

Orbsec is a made-up company which is developing an asset management application. 

The application covers critical elements, such as inventory and license-management. This project is an ilustration of that application and represents my own interpretation & implementation of the '[Spring Microservices in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-microservices-in-action-second-edition?query=Spring%20Microservices%20in%20action)' book project by John Carnell & Illary Huaylupo SÃ¡nchez, Manning 2021
